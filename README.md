# Animal Classification Model
This repository contains a deep learning model trained to classify images of various animals as well as humans using Teachable Machine.
## What is the model classifying?
The model classifies images into six different categories of animals and humans. It can identify and distinguish between cats, cows, deer, goats, chickens, and humans through a webcam.
# Dataset
The training data was sourced from the Mendeley Data repository:
